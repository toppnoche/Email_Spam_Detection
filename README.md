# Spam Detection

In this repo we will train a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict weather a mail is spam or ham.

## Documentation

The email_dataset is cleaned and trained on Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam predict spam.

In this repo we have focused on reducing the (false positive)


 *Firstly data is cleaned

    1) Removal of punctuations
    2) Converting all words to lower case
    3) Removing Stop words
 *Tokens are generated

 *Naive Bayes classifier is used to train the data on Tokens

 *And finally it is tested on test dataset

 # Similar steps were used in the 'advanced_spam_detection' but ensemble learning approach was used to minimize the false positive of spam which became 0 after implementation of ensemble learning.As wrong classification of ham email into spam is more dangerous.
